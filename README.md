**Features**
 Real-Time facial emotion recognition
 Disply detected emotions uisng corresponding emojis
 Graphical User Interface built with Tkinter 
 Works with a pre-trained deep learning model
 Easy-to-Use and interactive

 **Installation & Setup**
 Python 3.8+
 TensorFlow
 OpenCV
 Numpy
 PIL
 Tkinter (which is default in python)

 **Install Required Libraries**
 Run thi cmd :
cmd : **pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy pillow**
